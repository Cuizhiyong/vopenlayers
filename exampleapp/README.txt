This is example project that uses OpenLayers Wrapper for Vaadin.

Things to check to make it work in your own application:

 - pom.xml : basic dependencies
 - VolExampleWidgetSet.gwt.xml : gwt dependencies and injecting extra javascripts that are used in the demo
 - VolExampleApplication : how to set up some layers and how to use basic drawing features
