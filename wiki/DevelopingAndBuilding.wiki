#summary Quick instructions how to build vopenlayers from the source

= Building =

 * install subversion (google it)
 * install maven (google it)
 * check out the source code. See http://code.google.com/p/vopenlayers/source/checkout
 * go to the project directory using command line (cd vopenlayers-read-only)
 * run maven install target ( mvn install)
 * use the addon jar file from target directory or straight from your local maven repository

Using IDE for doing the same thing should work just fine too

== GWT compiling/debugging ==

Note that the gwt maven plugin is commented out from the pom.xml file. To build and test using the addon project one must either comment out that part or use GWT directly (e.g. via eclipse launch configuration). The latter is the approach used by the original author. The development cycle gets little faster that way.  Settings for using GWT directly:

main class: com.google.gwt.dev.Compiler

program arguments: -gen generated -draftCompile -war target/vol/VAADIN/widgetsets org.vaadin.vol.demo.VolExampleAppWidgetset -style PRETTY

vm args:  -Xmx1024M -Xms512M

For debugger the main class is com.google.gwt.dev.Compiler and program arguments: 
-noserver org.vaadin.vol.demo.VolExampleAppWidgetset http://localhost:9998

Also note that it becomes much faster to compile the code (for debugging) if you only compile the permutation for the browsers you are using. E.g. remove comment around this code snippet (<set-property name="user.agent" value="safari"/>)  in VolExampleAppWidgetset.gwt.xml file.

== development server ==

The projects test package also contains VolTestServer class which contains a very fast jetty launching for development purposes.
