#summary Instructions how to use vopenlayers

= Using vopenlayers =

1. add maven dependency
2. update (or create and update) your widgetset to inherit volwidgetset: mvn vaadin:update-widgetset
3. Check your widgetset. Ensure it has only <inherits name="org.vaadin.vol.VolWidgetsetWithHostedScript" /> or <inherits name="org.vaadin.vol.VolWidgetset" /> depending how you wish to serve openlayers scripts

Optional steps:
 * include openlayers scipts if you don't use the "hosted script" version of the widgetset
 * include other scripts like open street maps or google maps api if needed

vopenlayers is basically a Vaadin addon, containing both client and server side classes. The widgetset (GWT module) also contains some classes that may be used as is in pure GWT applications. The jar file can be downloaded from the downloads page.

check general instructions for Vaadin addons from the Directory:
http://vaadin.com/directory

In several places the documentation is non-existent. API should though be descriptive especially if openlayers itself is somewhat familiar for the developer. OpenLayers docs may thus be for a great help.
